# Experimental Design and Analysis
### Projects to establish causality and draw reliable conclusions from experimental data.

Experimental design involves designing the experiment in a way that minimizes the effects of extraneous variables and maximizes the internal validity of the results. This includes identifying the research question, selecting the sample, determining the experimental conditions, and establishing the methods of data collection.

Analysis of the data obtained from the experiment involves applying statistical tests and other analytical techniques to determine the significance of the observed differences between the experimental conditions. This process aims to determine the causal effects of the independent variables on the dependent variables, while controlling for the effects of confounding variables.
